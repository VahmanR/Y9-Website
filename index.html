    What are the UN SDGs?
  </h2>

  <p class="solid">
    The UN SDGs are a set of 17 goals made by the United Nations, with the hope that they will be acheived by 2030. The goals are 
    meant to make the world more sustainable. This would be acheived by doing things such as reducing pollution, or giving everyone
    access to quality education. A full list of the UN SDGs can be found here -> <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">List of all UN SDGs</a>

      UN SDG 4 is "Ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning."
      This goal is focused around giving every person around the world access to quality education
      to allow them to be able to get a job which will give them financial stability. Many of the subgoals
      focus on giving everyone access to education, an example would be making primary and secondary education 
      free around the world.

      UN SDG 5 is "Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. "
      This would be achieved by giving all girls and women equal access to 
      education, health care and decent work, as well as giving equal 
      representation in political and economical decision making. This is 
      important as gender equality is considered to be a fundemental
      human right. Acheiving this goal would also be the fundemental basis
      for a peaceful and prosporus world.

    How are these two goals related?
  </h2>
  <p class="solid">
    There is a strong corelation between the education level of women and their 
    gender equality. An example of this is that as the women started to get the
    same education level as men, the amount of women in national parliments
    also rose with it.
