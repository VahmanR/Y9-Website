  What is Goal 5?
</h2>

<p class="solid">
  UN SDGs goal 5 is Acheive gender equality and empower all women and girls. In many countries around 
  the world women are treated worse than men. Some indicators of this are the % of people in positions of 
  power who are women. The image to the left shows the % of women in positions of power around the
  world. In all 3 sets of data, about 70% of people in positions of power are men. To acheive gender parity,
  the amount of men and women in the same position would need to be 50/50. This would show that the job 
  is given equal to both genders.

<p class="solid" >
  Acheiving gender equality is very important. This is because gender equality is a fundemental human right
  and giving everyone an equal voice in decision making would lead to a significantly more peaceful world.
  Currently, most job positions do not meet gender parity. If a gender parity of 1 was achieved for all 
  professions, this would show that there is much less discrimination in our societies, and it would have a 
  massive positive impact on the lives of billions of people around the world.
